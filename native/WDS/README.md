#### Description ####
This problem seeks the optimal design of various water distribution systems
to minimize the total capital cost associated with pipe components and
maximize the network resilience.  12 different systems are considered, including
* Two-reservior Network (TRN)
* Two-loop Network (TLN)
* BakRyan Network (BAK)
* New York Tunnel Network (NYT)
* Blacksburg Network (BLA)
* Hanoi Network (HAN)
* GoYang Network (GOY)
* Fossolo Network (FOS)
* Pescara Network (PES)
* Modena Network (MOD)
* Belerma Irrigation Network (BIN)
* Exeter Network (EXN)
