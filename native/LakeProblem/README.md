# Lake Problem

Contents: 
* `LakeProblem_4obj_1const_Control.cpp`: C++ source code for the 4 objective formulation
* `MakefileLake`: makefile that compiles the lake model, Borg and the SOWs generating code
* `Random1000SOWs.cpp`: code written by Riddhi in C++ to generate SOW files for 9 states of the world
that may be specified on line 316 of the lake model code
* `moeaframework.c` and `moeaframework.h`: provides methods included in the LakeProblem C++ code for use with the MOEAFramework. 
These are necessary to compile the code as written. 

To compile and run:


* Download the Borg source code. Put all Borg and Lake Source in the same directory.

* Type the following command `make -f MakefileLake` to compile Borg, the Lake Problem code, and the SOW generating code 

* Before you can use the lake model, you will need to generate SOW files.  This can be done simply by typing
`./Random1000SOWs.exe` and moving the desired SOW file to the directory in which you are performing the optimization.

* To optimize the lake problem with Borg use the following command

Also, note if running these on thecube the executable names will not end in ".exe".  Otherwise, they will remain the same.
